# My e-portfolio about Docusaurus

Welcome to my e-Portfolio about Docusaurus! This repository contains the source code and documentation for my e-Portfolio at the DHBW Karlsruhe.

## Getting Started

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/DenRayk/e-portfolio_docusaurus/tree/master/eportfolio?file=README.md)

### OR

To get started with my e-Portfolio, simply clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DenRayk/e-portfolio_docusaurus.git
cd ./eportfolio
npm install
```
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```sh
npm start
```
This will launch a local development server at http://localhost:3000, where you can view and interact with the website.

---

Customizing the e-Portfolio
My e-Portfolio is built using Docusaurus, a modern static website generator. You can customize the website to suit your needs by editing the configuration files and page content.

The main configuration file is docusaurus.config.js, which contains settings for the website's theme, plugins, and pages. You can also create new pages by adding Markdown files to the docs directory, and they will automatically be rendered as HTML pages.

---

Building and Deploying the e-Portfolio
To build a production-ready version of the e-Portfolio, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate a static build of the website in the build directory, which can be deployed to any web hosting service.
